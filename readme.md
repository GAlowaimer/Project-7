## Dataset

> This dataset for Ford GoBike System year 2018 from https://www.lyft.com/bikes/bay-wheels/system-data. It's includes 1863721 trips with 15 features ( trip duration, start time, end time, start station id, start station name, start station latitude, start station longitude, end station id, end station name, end station latitude, end station longitude, bike id, user type, bike share for all trip, month ). Most variables are numeric in nature, but the variables start time, end time, start station name, end station name, user type, bike share for all trip and month are string object


## Summary of Findings

 #### Univariate: 
 > The majority of the average duration of the trips is almost taken 600 hundred seconds equals to 10 minute which we can consider it a short time. Also, I found that in the user type variable, the subscribers were much more than customers which means they have lots of clients not only a customer use it for one time
 
 #### Bivariate: 
 > Most of the relationship between all numeric variables were negative correlation but I found also few strong correlation. In general, the subscriber has more trips than customers through all months also, I notice that  The distribution for the subscribers vary but for the customer, they were very close. I found that October is the most frequent month for the subscriber. For the customer June, July and Augest and least frequent month was January for both. Almost all of the seasons were close to each other and most of the trips reached 24 minute but there is slightly different that Summer season has the longest trip duration

 #### Multivariate: 
 > The customer has the longest trip duration through all of the months. Sunday and Saturday in the first months of the year the rush time was approximate about 35 minute to 40 minute after it's open 


## Key Insights for Presentation

> Rush time per month for weekdays were Sunday and Saturday in the first months of the year the rush time was approximate about 35 minute to 40 minute after it's open. Also, with the weekdays varible it has an impact on the result for the months because I found that the rush time at begging of the year months and in two days unlike before with user type was in the October
